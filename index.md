I am Avtej Rhyner and I am a computer science major who plans to hopefully graduate in 2028.

## Favorite labs from CPSC120L

Lab 7, Part 1

This was my favorite lab because I found it satisfying creating loops to create certain parking conditions. It was also some very good practice writing code on multiple different files and implementing them to make parking conditions. This really helped sharpen my looping skills and get used to the language of c++. 

Lab 6, Part 2

This was also another one of my favorite labs because I was introduced to a new concept not just in computer science but also a new game called blackjack. It required a lot of if statements and that really helped me get used to doing those. I found it a very interesting, fun, and easy lab.

Lab 2

Lab 2 was one of those labs that I found as a very good way to introduce me to the c++ language. The lab required us to write a sentences using basic strings and std::cout and cin's as well. I felt that this introductory assignment really opened up my thoughts about coding and I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about how much more I could achieve with the c++ language.
